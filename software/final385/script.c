"I don¡¯t know what T.S. Eliot meant when he said ¡°April is the cruelest month¡± or what made him say that, but I do know for a fact that April is the cruelest month",
"On April 1st, Lab 10 was posted by the TAs as a cute joke. This lab required us to implement deep learning from scratch. We all chuckled at the impossibility and glanced through the lab page to join the festivity of April fools.",
"Our professor, Zuofu Cheng saw that and thought it actually was a good lab for us to do.",
"He thought that this would prepare us for the industry and raise the value of UIUC engineering degree.",
"If it wasn¡¯t already hard enough, he banned NIOS II. We can¡¯t program in C because according to him ¡°C stands for Cheating¡±.",
"He also adjusted the grading policy to make the Lab 10 to be 50%.",
"April is the cruelest month. No, April 2019 is.",
"So, here I am in the lab waiting for my partner. It¡¯s Thursday afternoon and we¡¯ve been burnt out.",
"Thanks to Zuofu, we need to pass this lab or else we won¡¯t be graduating.",
"That means that Shenyi wouldn¡¯t be going to Swiss grad school and I would have to turn down on my offers.",
"She comes through the front door."
